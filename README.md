  Whatsapp Message Scheduler<br>

<p align="center">
A simple message scheduling tool for WhatsApp private chats or groups. Built to make sure your messages are seen at the right time.
</p>

## Why We Built This

In our group, important messages often vanished into the noise — sent at odd hours, buried under a flood of chats, and seen too late (or not at all). We built this tool to change that. With manual scheduling, you control exactly when your message hits.

## Architecture

![High Level Architecture](./docs/architecture.drawio.svg)

Available services:

- `Server and Dashboard Service` => Handling dashboard and api requests from clients. For the API details see [this doc](./docs/rest_api.md).
- `WhatsApp Publisher` => External Whatsapp publisher service. This service is responsible for sending messages to WhatsApp. Right now the built-in adapter supports [go-whatsapp-web-multidevice](https://github.com/aldinokemal/go-whatsapp-web-multidevice), but WA Scheduler does not manage its login, session, or deployment.
- `Storage` => This service is responsible for storing all the message state. The database schema is available [here](./docs/db/schema.sql). Currently, it only supports MySQL.

## Features

- Schedule messages for private chats or groups
- Set exact send times
- Retry send

## Getting Started

### Locally (Docker)

1. Run and log in to your WhatsApp publisher outside this project.
2. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ghazlabs/wa-scheduler.git

    WA_PUBLISHER_API_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 \
    WA_PUBLISHER_USERNAME=admin \
    WA_PUBLISHER_PASSWORD=admin \
      make run
    ```

3. Open <http://localhost:9866> to access the dashboard
4. Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`
5. Schedule messages from the dashboard
6. To get group recipient ids, use your WhatsApp Publisher service directly.

### Production

TBD
